# Reinforcement Learning: Implementations following theory books
This is an experiments project with code that implements some of the ideas read in theory books on RL. 

Some of the books: 
* [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction - Sutton & Barto](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/739791.Reinforcement_Learning)

## Index
* [Greedy & $\epsilon$-Greedy algorithms in Multi-arm Bandit](multi-arm-bandit.ipynb) - Analyzes the most basic learning algorithms on a multi-arm bandit problem. 
* [Dynamic Programming approach to solving problems](dyn-prog.ipynb) - Usage of DP to solve problems when the world model is known
